# Causal Co-op Learner for Overcooked

This project explores a **cooperative learning agent** in the Overcooked environment, leveraging **causal reasoning and structured interventions** for effective team play. Unlike traditional imitation learning, which passively mimics expert trajectories, our approach enables the agent to actively **infer causal relationships** between actions and outcomes, leading to **adaptive and robust cooperation** with human or AI teammates.

## ðŸ”¥ Key Features
- **Causal Discovery in Multi-Agent Coordination** â€“ Identifies key dependencies in team actions.
- **Structured Interventions for Skill Learning** â€“ Learns interventions that maximize cooperative efficiency.
- **Generalizable Decision-Making** â€“ Adapts to different teammate styles and environment layouts.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
This research aims to **bridge causal learning and cooperative AI**, pushing towards **more interpretable and human-aligned coordination strategies**.

## ðŸ“Œ To-Do
- [ ] Implement causal discovery in Overcooked trajectories.
- [ ] Design intervention-based policy learning.
- [ ] Evaluate adaptability with different teammate styles.
- [ ] Benchmark against standard imitation learning approaches.
